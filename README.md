Block Templater
---

This plugin makes it simple for editors to create and manage page templates that are designed with Gutenberg blocks for multitenant WordPress websites.

1. Build templates using the WordPress Gutenberg editor.
2. Designate a default template for each post type (including custom post types).
3. Insert template content while editing a post on the fly, using the WordPress API.
4. Change the CSS theme of a post or set a default theme for different post types.
5. Create and manage "buckets" for categorized Gutenberg blocks, which can be assigned to specific post types.
6. Manage user access to maintain a separation of concerns across multitenant sites.
